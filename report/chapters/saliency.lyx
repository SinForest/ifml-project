Generating Saliency Maps of Input Images

Saliency Maps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Saliency maps are an easy way to highlight parts of an input image of a
 neural network, that were responsible, that the network decided in a certain
 way.
 They are inspired by the basics of the back propagation algorithm, which
 states that the gradients obtained at a layer L equal the gradient of the
 loss incurred by the subnet below L, with respect to the outputs at L.
 So backpropagating until the input layer is reached will yield the gradient
 of the loss incurred by the whole network with respect to the input itself.
 This gradient yields us the importance over the whole image.
 In order to get this gradient we need to do some adjustments to our trained
 networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generating a saliency map for an input image requires a different approach
 to the handling of the network.
 We need to define two hook functions that need to be assigned to different
 parts of the network.
 One that modifies the Rectified Linear Units so that they can only return
 positive gradients.
 And one that saves the gradients of the first layer, the image values,
 to a global variable when backpropagating.
 Once the model is created pretrained on ImageNet, the functions are assigned
 to their respective layers.
 After that we modify the model so that it fits our number of classes and
 input size and load the latest training state.
 Now the model is ready to create saliency maps.
 We pass an image once through the network, zero the gradients of the network
 and after that perform a backwards step with a one-hot-vector of a certain
 label suiting the image.
 The hook function is saving the data we need, which we then can easily
 save into a .jpg-file.

Unfortunately our approach to saliency maps only worked for our VGG16 model
 and partly for Inception_v3.
 For the other architectures we got Cuda out of memory errors when working
 on single images, even though we trained the same models the day before
 with significantly higher batch sizes or the resulting images were completely
 black.
 We couldn't fix these problems in time.
 The results of the VGG16 model are quite interesting though.
 One would expect, that a model like ours with such heavy overfitting would
 highlight the whole image, if the image is from the training set.
 And this is the case here, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Batman-'The-Brave"

\end_inset

 shows the original movieposter fed to the network, followed by the respective
 saliency map on the right.
 The saliency map has almost no empty parts, and the maps don't differ for
 different classes that they were made for.
 One would also think, that the saliency maps for unknown images would be
 different, but this is not the case.
 The maps for all examples are pretty dense and only have holes on larger
 parts without any shape.
 This leads to the conclusion, that indeed the whole movie poster is necessary
 to determine the genre of the respective movie.
 But then there are the saliency maps of our Inception_v3 model, that had
 the highest accuracy on the training set of all pretrained architectures.
 Here the maps differ for each genre that the original movie had, but they
 are still quite similar.
 The maps also dont have any particular shape or color that is humanly understan
dable.
 With these maps it looks like Inception_v3 is determining its outcome based
 on discrete pixels of the input image.
 Maybe Inception_v3 found some unintuitive way to decide which genre it
 is seeing, but we do not want to rule out that we might have made some
 mistakes during the implementation.
 Also even Inception_v3 is still relatively far away from reliably determining
 the genre of a movieposter.
 Sadly, we cannot use these maps of both architectures to determine some
 characteristic parts of movieposters for any specific genre, that would
 be recognizable for a human.
 Maybe if these models, or our own network could be trained on a larger
 data set, as well as our own model learning task specific filters, saliency
 maps could give us more useful information.
